# Food-Fiasco
An incomplete game I made during summer of 2015 about food attacking people.   
  
The Game is a RPG style game that has top down shooter elements that went off the idea, "what if food invaded the world and started attacking people?" It was a silly game that was poking fun at the typical zombie apocalypse kind of games. Instead of murderous zombies, you have food. Basically was an playground for programming concepts I self learned.  
  
I also made a short lived series on making this game, since why not.
